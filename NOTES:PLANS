NOTES/PLANS etc.

Plan for the next coding session is as follows:
    1. Identify structure of the data saved in my files
    2. Identify relevant information from the given data <- what could actually be useful for further analysis
    3. Entwicklung des Prozesses zur Trennung relevanter und irrelevanter Daten
    4. Find reasonable data format to store it to
    5. Think about how to analyze the data



3. 
 - define relevant data right from the beginning (z.B. as dict) -> scan available date for the information that I'm looking for 
 - e.g. if author in entry: dict['author'] = entry['author']



 DEFINITIONS:

 entry: element in json-files provided by doaj
