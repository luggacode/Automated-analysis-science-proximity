NOTES/PLANS etc.

PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
 - calculate proximity between scientists
 - parameters: shared publications of papers, similarity of paper titles/abstracts, journal, etc? 

Plan for the next coding session is as follows:
    1. Identify structure of the data saved in my files
    2. Identify relevant information from the given data <- what could actually be useful for further analysis
    3. Entwicklung des Prozesses zur Trennung relevanter und irrelevanter Daten
    4. Find reasonable data format to store it to
    5. Think about how to analyze the data

AUSWERTUNGSIDEEN
-> Veröffentlichungsfrequenzen in Themengebieten (welches Thema liegt im Trend)
-> Welche Nation besonders viel in welchem Thema
-> Welcher Autor weist welche connections zu welchem anderen Autoren auf 

NEW GOAL:
- Create a world map of scientific institutions
- Map all the institutions based on the OpenAlex Data Snapshot
- based on the institutions focus on authors and their publications (see plan)

plan:
-> find author with at least 10 publications 
-> find every author this author published with (TOP PRIORITY)
-> find author keywords
-> calculate bm-25 from abstracts from main author to abstracts of all the authors who published with main author ()
-> plot h-index development of author 
-> rank similarity to other authors by adding up bm-25 scores of every abstract of main author compared to the other author divided by the mean of the two abstract counts
-> find which author tends to cite which author








NOTES:

mini goal 1:
    - plot only scientists from specific countries based on plotting of related authors achieved beforehand
    - include up to 5 keywords in information shown when hovering over author

mini goal 2:
    - plot researchers with similar research topics as main_author
    - HOW:
    - Finding a researchers most important topic
    - Finding top n works related to this topic
    - extract researchers from these works
    - plot researchers with corresponding publication title




Open Alex IDs to work with
    - Dirks: a5063212181
    - De Pitta: a5077227646
    - 
Which Open Alex API prompts are needed:

-> prompt showing scientist with OpenAlex-ID xyz: 
https://api.openalex.org/authors/FILL-IN-ID
-> prompt showing scientist with Orcid-ID xyz: 
https://api.openalex.org/authors/https://orcid.org/FILL-IN-ID
https://api.openalex.org/authors/orcid:FILL-IN-ID
From this one can derive the OpenAlex_ID -> which is available for every scientist listet on OpenAlex
-> prompt showing works published by author with OpenAlex ID xyz
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=author.id:A5042522694
INTERESTING: As it seems, every work has the feature is_in_doaj which could be helpful lateron when trying to introduce keywords etc. 
-> prompt showing authors 

Which ROR API prompts are needed:
-> prompt to retrieve information on organization with ROR ID xyz
https://api.ror.org/v2/organizations/FILL-IN-ROR-ID








HISTORY (what has bee achieved):
- based on openAlex ID of an author 
- map this author on a world map CHECK
- find every author the main author published with CHECK
- do a connections mapping, mapping the connected authors on the world map as well CHECK

DEFINITIONS:
 entry: element in json-files provided by doaj
