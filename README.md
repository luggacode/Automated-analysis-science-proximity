Ein weiteres Projekt ist geboren hurra, background lautet wie folgt:

Dear Mr. Mitchell,

I am Luca Bevilacqua a 4th semester student of Biomimetics at the University of Applied Sciences in Bremen, Germany. As part of our curriculum we are obligated to spend 16 weeks abroad as part of a research group to gain practical experience in the world of science.
When applying for different teams I reckoned that some kind of map that shows the scientific proximity between each scientist would be helpful as one could find more persons doing research on a similar field. In this way you could find research groups that match your interests more easily.
Moreover being interested into politics I felt that measuring the proximity between scientists of different countries would be quite interesting as well as determining the impact countries have in different scientific fields.
Your weekly data dumps perfectly match with this idea as they would enable me to work with a huge dataset that updates continuously. Therefore I would be very grateful about access to the journal and article metadata and if possible to recent data dumps!

Kind regards,
Luca Bevilacqua
